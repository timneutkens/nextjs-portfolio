    content: "This idea originated from my mother's inspiration. She was always worried when my father flew and wanted to know everything about the flight. With this application I have tried to respond to her desires. The app uses data from Aviation Edge API, Air France API, Darksky API and the Mapbox API. The application can follow KLM's flights, it provides information about the current location, the flight completion rate, aircraft speed, current location weather, nearest storm and much more!",
